        "This Notebook is meant to contain the 16S_OTU data found within the respective manuscript. It contains only the code used to generate the figures found within the main text. This entire dataset is publically available in QIITA under the ID [10527](https://qiita.ucsd.edu/study/description/10527). More details about the procedures used to generate the data can be found within the **Methods** section of the manuscript. The table found within the data folder has been processed to remove any OTU less than 0.01% relative abundance."
