This folder only contains the 16S OTU analysis used to plot Figure 1b, Figure 1c, Figure 1d, and Figure 1e. The IPython notebook can be used as long as QIIME 1.9.1 scripts are installed and available in the $PATH. 

The files located in the data/ folder is the OTU table from the PulsePAT experiment. For the entire dataset, see the QIITA repository here: https://qiita.ucsd.edu/study/description/10527
