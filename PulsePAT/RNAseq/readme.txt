# How to use
This folder is meant to be cloned to gather local references to input data. Use the Rmarkdown to re-import the data and re-create the figures used in the publication. This Rmd file contains the code to create Figure 2f and Figure 2d.

The .Rda object found within the data/ folder is the DESeq2 object of gene summarized counts (with featureCounts) and the sample metadata. For the entire dataset, see ArrayExpress here: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-5101/
